If you're reading this, your name is probably Tanner.  Just kidding, but seriously, I expect only one person to be here right now.  

Thank you for checking out my fledgling website.  I'm very excited to start recording my thoughts for posterity!  In case you were wondering, my thoughts are generally about taking photos, making videos, and the gear, software, and expertise that it takes to accomplish these tasks.  I, myself, am a Canon/Mac man, but the great thing about photography and videography is that the gear is just one tiny piece in the puzzle.  

Check back for updates about tips, tricks, methods, and Oxford commas about making beautiful images and compelling videos.  

Thanks!
